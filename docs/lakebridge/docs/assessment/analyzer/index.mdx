#  Analyzer Guide

## Analyzer Insights

The **Lakebridge Analyzer** is built to scan and interpret metadata from ETL pipelines and SQL assets. Its analysis provides several key insights:

- **Job Complexity Assessment**
Analyzer evaluates the complexity of your ETL and SQL jobs. These metrics are fed into the **Conversion Calculator** to help estimate both software licensing costs and the engineering hours required for the migration.

- **Comprehensive Job Inventory**
It generates a full inventory of components such as mappings, programs, transformations, functions, and dynamic variables—giving you a clear picture of what exists in your legacy environment.

- **Cross-System Interdependency Mapping**
Analyzer identifies **interdependencies** between jobs, systems, and components — surfacing how different parts of your codebase interact. This is crucial for sequencing migration efforts, minimizing risk, and avoiding disruption during cutover planning.



## Verify Installation
Verify the successful installation by executing the provided command; confirmation of a successful installation is indicated when the displayed output aligns with the example screenshot provided:
```bash
 databricks labs lakebridge analyze --help
 ```

## Preparation Step
To prepare to use Analyzer the metadata needs to be extracted from the legacy system(s). This is done by exporting the metadata to a file system and ultimately making it available in a folder accessible by Analyzer. For a SQL database this is typically done by exporting the SQL files out of the database platform. For ETL/ELT solutions this is done by exporting their repository objects, this usually exports to some kind of *XML* or *JSON* format.
For examples and instructions of the metadata export process, please refer to the page Exporting Legacy Metadata.



## Execution Pre-Set Up
Analyzer accepts as an input a folder name containing the files and subfolders to be scanned, and the Excel report filename to be generated, containing all the collected information.

Below is the detailed explanation on the arguments required for Analyzer.
- `source-directory [Required]` - Absolute folder path containing the legacy artifacts.
- `report-file [Required]` - Name of the report file to produce the information info.  Must have .xlsx extension
#### Before starting the execution, Analyzer will prompt for the type of technology it is scanning

## Execution
Execute the below command to initialize the transpile process.
```bash
 databricks labs lakebridge analyze --source-directory <absolute-path> --report-file <absolute-path>
```
