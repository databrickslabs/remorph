## SQL Code Analysis
At the beginning of script analysis, mark a script with complexity level of **LOW**

If any of the following conditions are true, then mark the job as **MEDIUM** complexity:
1. At least one loop
2. Conventional Statement count greater than 10
3. Simple Statement count greater than 1000
4. Number of pivot statements between 1 and 3
5. Number of XML SQL statements between 1 and 3

If any of the following conditions are true, then mark the job as **COMPLEX** complexity:
1. Number of loops greater than 5
2. Conventional Statement count greater than 30
3. Simple Statement count greater than 2000
4. Number of pivot statements greater than 3
5. Number of XML SQL statements greater than 3

If any of the following conditions are true, then mark the job as **VERY COMPLEX** complexity:
1. Number of loops greater than 8
2. Conventional Statement count greater than 50
3. Simple Statement count greater than 5000
4. Number of pivot statements greater than 5
5. Number of XML SQL statements greater than 5

Simple Statement count is determined by regex patterning in analyzer config file. Conventional Statement count is determined by below formula:

Conventional Statement count = Total Statement count - Simple Statement count

If the analyzer encounters a SQL procedure or function body inside a SQL file, it will categorize the script as "ETL" for licensing purposes.

Teradata MLOAD and FLOAD scripts follow the same rules as above.
