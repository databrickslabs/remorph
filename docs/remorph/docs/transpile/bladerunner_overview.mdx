## Bladerunner Functionality Overview

**Bladerunner** (formerly BladeBridge Converter) is a code conversion engine designed to modernize ETL and SQL workloads into Databricks-native formats.

It supports both:
- **SQL-based platforms** (e.g., Oracle, Teradata, Netezza, SQL Server, Snowflake)
- **ETL platforms** (e.g., Informatica, DataStage)

---

## Conversion Model

### SQL Input Files

For each SQL source file, Bladerunner generates a **single output file** containing the translated Databricks-compatible logic. This can include:
- **Tables and view definitions**
- **Databricks SQL scripting stored procedures**

> **Note:** Bladerunner supports SQL scripting constructs, and source stored procedures are translated to Databricks SQL scripting equivalents.

### ETL Input Files

ETL source files may produce **multiple outputs**, depending on job type:

| ETL Job Type             | Output Format                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Transformational Jobs    | Databricks **Notebooks** (cells)    |
| Workflow/Orchestration   | Databricks **Workflow JSON**        |

Each ETL component is translated into a logical code block, with mapping maintained across source and target systems.

## Configuration-Driven Execution

Bladerunner runs based on a **configuration file**, allowing you to define:

- Input/output directories
- Source and target technologies
- Custom naming conventions
- Extension points for converter plugins
