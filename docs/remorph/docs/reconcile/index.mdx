# Remorph Reconciliation

Reconcile is an automated tool designed to streamline the reconciliation process between source data and target data
residing on Databricks. Currently, the platform exclusively offers support for Snowflake, Oracle and other Databricks
tables as the primary data source. This tool empowers users to efficiently identify discrepancies and variations in data
when comparing the source with the Databricks target.


### Execution Pre-Set Up
>1. Setup the configuration file:

Once the installation is done, a folder named **.remorph** will be created in the user workspace's home folder.
To process the reconciliation for specific table sources, we must create a config file that gives the detailed required configurations for the table-specific ones.
The file name should be in the format as below and created inside the **.remorph** folder.
```
recon_config_<SOURCE>_<CATALOG_OR_SCHEMA>_<REPORT_TYPE>.json

Note: For CATALOG_OR_SCHEMA , if CATALOG exists then CATALOG else SCHEMA
```

eg:

| source_type | catalog_or_schema | report_type | file_name                             |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| databricks  | tpch | all | recon_config_databricks_tpch_all.json |
| source1     | tpch | row | recon_config_source1_tpch_row.json    |
| source2     | tpch | schema | recon_config_source2_tpch_schema.json |


``` bash

> 2. Setup the connection properties

Remorph-Reconcile manages connection properties by utilizing secrets stored in the Databricks workspace.
Below is the default secret naming convention for managing connection properties.

**Note: When both the source and target are Databricks, a secret scope is not required.**

**Default Secret Scope:** remorph_data_source

| source | scope |
|--------|-------|
| snowflake | remorph_snowflake |
| oracle | remorph_oracle |
| databricks | remorph_databricks |

Below are the connection properties required for each source:
#### snowflake
```yaml

sfUrl = https://<acount_name>.snowflakecomputing.com
account = <acount_name>
sfUser = <user>
sfPassword = <password>
sfDatabase = <database>
sfSchema = <schema>
sfWarehouse = <warehouse_name>
sfRole = <role_name>
pem_private_key = <pkcs8_pem_private_key>
```
Note: For Snowflake authentication, either sfPassword or pem_private_key is required.
Priority is given to pem_private_key, and if it is not found, sfPassword will be used.
If neither is available, an exception will be raised.


#### oracle
``` yaml
user = <user>
password = <password>
host = <host>
port = <port>
database = <database/SID>
```


### Execution
Execute the below command to initialize the reconcile process.
```bash
 databricks labs remorph reconcile
```
